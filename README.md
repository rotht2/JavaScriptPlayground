# JavaScriptPlayground
This is just a playground I am creating to enhance my JavaScript skills

# Notes
So far I have been following along through a tutorial in JavaScript on https://javascript.info/
There are a lot of interesting ideas that he has been talking about and I have been creating js files to practice/follow along with the lessons. The JavaScript files are full of comments that represent my notes on basic ideas and how they are done in JavaScript. 

# To Come. 
After I have completed adding a bunch of notes I would like to venture down the process of learning react, and using JavaScript to create a cool application. My only criteria so far for this app is that it is cool so I am going to put down some ideas as I am thinking of them here and who knows maybe I will come up with something :)

# P.S.
This also is allowing me to brush up on my Git skills.. I guess you could say that I am trying to Git good 

# TDD
Hitting the tdd section of the training now which is great! Starting down the path to writing unit tests with mocha!
