/** Writing tests
 *  Tests in JavaScript are often times called 'specs'. Specs have 3 main parts to them:
 *    - describe: describes the functionality that we are going to be testing
 *    - it: a human readable way to describe what this specific test is doing
 *    - assert.*: assertions that must be correct, often times they are boolean expressions
 * 
 *  I prefer to use TDD, so I often have my test open on the left side of my screen and the source code I am
 *  implementing on the left.
